I had no idea that on some nights I got 9+ hours of sleep (on one night I slept for nearly 12 hours!). Yet, I'm tired much of the time. I suspect that maybe much of my tiredness is mental rather than physical, but the fact that I also skip sleep some nights and vary wildly in when I actually try going to sleep doesn't help.<br />That being said, these results have prompted me to look into whether there may also be something physical at play."
